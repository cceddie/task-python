taskpy.py

this is a pythhon script that parses the output of task, a great list program
made by Paul Beckingham and a few others.  Learn more at taskwarrior.org.

task is released under a GPL license (I think)

taskpy should pick a license, but i suspect it wil be GPL or BSD.  definitely
open source
