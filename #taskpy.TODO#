- i should see if someone else wants to take this over.  

- need to talk to paul and ask him if there is a programatic way to determine
  the columns that are available.  currently, i only see a list in one of the
  man pages

- the output parsing is rough at best.  it should be made more flexible, with
  even an eye to multiple line output.
  - how would this be easily codified?
  
- the display parameters are curr a silly array.  it owuld be nice if they
  were a file like .taskpyrc
  
- someone in the know needs to figure out if there are any odd python 
  dependencies.  i suspect that there are none (as my programming skills are
  weak enough to not use much out of the ordinary).
  - i am fairly certain that i am using deprecated commands/calls/functions/etc
    again, someone else will need to do that bit of code cleanup for me

- config so that taskpy looks for task and the .taskrc or pending database
  it should also make sure that it has file r/w permission somewhere
  
- global variable for date format
